# Python
# Basic Core Programs
1. User Input and Replace String Template “Hello <<UserName>>, How are you?”
a. I/P -> Take User Name as Input. Ensure UserName has min 3 char
b. Logic -> Replace <<UserName>> with the proper name
c. O/P -> Print the String with User Name

2. Flip Coin and print percentage of Heads and Tails
a. I/P -> The number of times to Flip Coin. Ensure it is positive integer.
b. Logic -> Use Random Function to get value between 0 and 1. If < 0.5 then tails or
heads
c. O/P -> Percentage of Head vs Tails

3. Leap Year
a. I/P -> Year, ensure it is a 4 digit number.
b. Logic -> Determine if it is a Leap Year.
c. O/P -> Print the year is a Leap Year or not.

4. Power of 2
a. Desc -> This program takes a command-line argument N and prints a table of the
powers of 2 that are less than or equal to 2^N.
b. I/P -> The Power Value N. Only works if 0 <= N < 31 since 2^31 overflows an int
c. Logic -> repeat until i equals N.

5. Harmonic Number
a. Desc -> Prints the Nth harmonic number: 1/1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/N
(http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~chvatal/notes/harmonic.html).
b. I/P -> The Harmonic Value N. Ensure N != 0
c. Logic -> compute 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/N
d. O/P -> Print the Nth Harmonic Value
.
6. Factors
a. Desc -> Computes the prime factorization of N using brute force.
b. I/P -> Number to find the prime factors
c. Logic -> Traverse till i*i <= N instead of i <= N for efficiency.
d. O/P -> Print the prime factors of number N.

#Functional Programs
1. 2D Array
a. Desc -> A library for reading in 2D arrays of integers, doubles, or booleans from
standard input and printing them out to standard output.
b. I/P -> M rows, N Cols, and M * N inputs for 2D Array. Use Java Scanner Class
c. Logic -> create 2 dimensional array in memory to read in M rows and N cols
d. O/P -> Print function to print 2 Dimensional Array. In Java use PrintWriter with
OutputStreamWriter to print the output to the screen.

2. Sum of three Integer adds to ZERO
a. Desc -> A program with cubic running time. Read in N integers and counts the
number of triples that sum to exactly 0.
b. I/P -> N number of integer, and N integer input array
c. Logic -> Find distinct triples (i, j, k) such that a[i] + a[j] + a[k] = 0
d. O/P -> One Output is number of distinct triplets as well as the second output is to
print the distinct triplets.

3. Write a program Distance.java that takes two integer command-line arguments x
and y and prints the Euclidean distance from the point (x, y) to the origin (0, 0). The
formulae to calculate distance = sqrt(x*x + y*y). Use Math.power function

4. Write a program Quadratic.java to find the roots of the equation a*x*x + b*x + c.
Since the equation is x*x, hence there are 2 roots. The 2 roots of the equation
can be found using a formula (Note: Take a, b and c as input values)
delta = b*b - 4*a*c
Root 1 of x = (-b + sqrt(delta))/(2*a)
Root 2 of x = (-b - sqrt(delta))/(2*a)

5. Write a program WindChill.java that takes two double command-line arguments t
and v and prints the wind chill. Use Math.pow(a, b) to compute ab. Given the
temperature t (in Fahrenheit) and the wind speed v (in miles per hour), the
National Weather Service defines the effective temperature (the wind chill) to be:
Note: the formula is not valid if t is larger than 50 in absolute value or if v is larger
than 120 or less than 3 (you may assume that the values you get are in that range).

#Logical Programs

1. Gambler
a. Desc -> Simulates a gambler who start with $stake and place fair $1 bets until
he/she goes broke (i.e. has no money) or reach $goal. Keeps track of the number of
times he/she wins and the number of bets he/she makes. Run the experiment N
times, averages the results, and prints them out.
b. I/P -> $Stake, $Goal and Number of times
c. Logic -> Play till the gambler is broke or has won
d. O/P -> Print Number of Wins and Percentage of Win and Loss.

2. Coupon Numbers
a. Desc -> Given N distinct Coupon Numbers, how many random numbers do you
need to generate distinct coupon number? This program simulates this random
process.
b. I/P -> N Distinct Coupon Number
c. Logic -> repeatedly choose a random number and check whether it's a new one.
d. O/P -> total random number needed to have all distinct numbers.
e. Functions => Write Class Static Functions to generate random number and to
process distinct coupons.

3. Simulate Stopwatch Program
a. Desc -> Write a Stopwatch Program for measuring the time that elapses between
the start and end clicks
b. I/P -> Start the Stopwatch and End the Stopwatch
c. Logic -> Measure the elapsed time between start and end
d. O/P -> Print the elapsed time.

4. Cross Game or Tic-Tac-Toe Game
a. Desc -> Write a Program to play a Cross Game or Tic-Tac-Toe Game. Player 1
is the Computer and the Player 2 is the user. Player 1 take Random Cell that is
the Column and Row.
b. I/P -> Take User Input for the Cell i.e. Col and Row to Mark the ‘X’
c. Logic -> The User or the Computer can only take the unoccupied cell. The Game
is played till either wins or till draw...
d. O/P -> Print the Col and the Cell after every step.
e. Hint -> The Hints is provided in the Logic. Use Functions for the Logic…
